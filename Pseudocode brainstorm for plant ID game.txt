Point Based Trivia/Memory game for plant id
Includes matching picture to latin and common names

naming uses

naming dangers

Points = 0
Lives = 3

while/for loop until max number of points reached or death
	switch btwn picture or name
	randomize plant and print chosen object
	give two random and 1 correct of the opposite object
	randomize the order
		three boxes - random between three
		selected box will contain true
		other two will have random
			add exception to prevent duplicates
		ask for user input
			if user input matches the selected box number for this instance
				point += 1
				i +=1
				else lives -= 1
Print: Game over (after updates the lives counter will change to two counters, starvation vs poisioning)			
End
Qs
	can you randomize an array or library while maintaining its integrity?
	possibly easier to make list (1,2,3,4,5) randomize order (5,1,3,2,4) then reference str(i)
	Or begin by randomizing library then have i be the place in the list the number occurs
	the plant ID will be unchanging and therefore work to verify whether it is correct
	Plant ID(int)	Plant Latin(str)	Plant Common(str)	Photo	Plant Edible?(Bool)	Uses(list)		Plant Toxic?(Bool)	Dangers(list)
	1		Fakus Latinus		Chicory			img1	true			Edible, teas, tinctures	false			empty
	2		nightshadus negros	Deadly Nightshade	img2	false			empty			true			vomit, death, etc
